# AES Image Encryption System Readme

## Introduction

The AES Image Encryption System is a software application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This system provides a secure and efficient way to protect sensitive image data from unauthorized access.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes the AES algorithm for robust encryption of image files.
- **Image Compatibility**: Supports various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more.
- **Encryption Key**: Allows users to specify an encryption key for added security.
- **Decryption**: Users can decrypt the encrypted images using the same key.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the AES Image Encryption System repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Nitesh544/AES-Image-Encryption-System).
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
3. To run the code, any python ide can be used like pycharm, juypter notebook, google collab.  
4. Following Libraries need to installed before running the python code  
  a. Dlib (The dlib library should be installed using this link: http://dlib.net/compile.html)  
	b. Scipy
